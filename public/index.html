      Business Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      AGS (Alternative Green Systems) build electrical turbines for the green power generation industry. Some of their most profitable projects include their wind and tidal turbines.
      AGS is a world leader in green power generation, with a focus on efficient harnessing of natural energy sources. Today, AGS technology delivers as much as 20% of U.S. electricity through multiple power providers. The company is growing rapidly as the world turns to green sources of energy.
      One of the more profitable trends in energy generation is not simply the sale of turbines, but continuous service contracts. These service contracts are useful for customers, who no longer have to develop expertise in a growing diversity of turbines, and are a major source of revenue for the company. Because of the value of these contracts, multiple original equipment manufacturer (OEM) companies compete for service contracts on each other’s turbines. AGS’s current strategy is to maintain a strong customer focus as a way to continue selling both tidal turbines and service contracts.
